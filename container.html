  <h2>Div Element</h2>

  <p>
    The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is used as a container for other block-level elements.
    It is a block-level element itself.
  </p>

  <div style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>This is a div container</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element can contain multiple block-level elements such as paragraphs,
      headings, or even other <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Block-Level Elements</h2>

  <p>Block-level elements take up the full width available and always start on a new line.</p>

  <h3>This is a Block-Level Element</h3>
  <p>
    This paragraph is a block-level element, so it starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its container.
  </p>

  <h3>Another Block-Level Element</h3>
  <p>
    This is another paragraph, which is also block-level. It starts on a new line below the heading.
  </p>

  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

  <p>
    Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
    Examples of inline elements include <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a <span style="color:blue;">span element</span> inside a paragraph. It does not start on a new line.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also have inline elements like <a href="#">links</a> or <strong>bold text</strong> within paragraphs,
    and they will not break the flow of the content.
